# Docs-first planning (ChartGPU)

Before creating a plan, proposing an API, or making implementation changes:

- Read the relevant files in `docs/` (start with `docs/API.md` and `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`).
- If the work touches public API or examples, also skim `README.md` for behavioral expectations.
- Base your plan on **documented contracts** (types, lifecycle, invariants, “critical” coordinate systems, safety notes like tooltip `innerHTML`, and WebGPU caveats).
- When uncertain, prefer the documented source links in `docs/` (e.g. `src/ChartGPU.ts`, `src/core/createRenderCoordinator.ts`) as the next place to confirm behavior.

When presenting the plan, explicitly call out which `docs/` sections informed it (by file + section heading).
